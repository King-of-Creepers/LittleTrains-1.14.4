this 2 folder contains all the assets have been ever created to the mod.

what you need to do:
-when you add a feature, remove from the todo folder, and the place it to the folder where it belongs.

why its organized like this? im not sure all the files have the same names, or im affraid of some file have been modified in one folder, 
and will overwrite the newer or elder files. i will clean it up.
and during the development, will turn out wich files are the duplicates and wich ones are the modified/updated ones.

im sure i need go trough them, cuz they have been made in 1.12's style... when you add a thing from the planned chat, 
i will look up on its texture and model to apply some "1.14-ness"
